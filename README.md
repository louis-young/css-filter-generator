# Recolour

A tool to generate the CSS filters to recolour an icon to a given colour.

![Recolour](documentation/recolour.jpg)

## Description

A toolthat given a target hexadecimal colour value, calculates the corresponding CSS `filter` properties to achieve the target colour.

## Motivation

I built this application as I often found myself needing colour variations of icons. This is a quick and easy way to achieve different coloured icons whilst using only one source image.

## Technologies

- JavaScript.
- React.
- Sass (BEM).
